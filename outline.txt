// Build a switch that toggles the game on

// Build a start button that can start the game

// When start is clicked, choose a random color and store this color
// in the global simonPlays array

// When user clicks button
  // Store this click in the userPlays array

  // Compare the two arrays

  // If they don't match
    // Play a 'game over' sound and end the game

  // If they do match
    // Check if this should be the last turn? If so, they've won the game

    // If not, Computer repeats the first move and shows the player the next
    // color and stores the next color in the simonPlays array

    // Add 1 to the level counter
